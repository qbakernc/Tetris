# Tetris
A fully function Tetris game was created out of a 16x8 LED matrix using USART communication to show the gameplay on the matrix. The game is played using a computer and the putty SSH client software. A bluetooth reveiver is connected to the microcontroller to receive controller input from the putty client.

What I learned
* Learned the basics of game design which include input detection, collision detection, and saving data.  
* Learned more about microcontroller interupts, USART communication, SPI communication, and timers.
* Learned how to create a random number generator using a timer and the unpredictability of player input.
